# Alhambra-magni-QSOsCVs
## ALHAMBRA magnitude of QSOs and CVs

Contains folders with the ALHAMBRA magnitudes of QSOs in several redshift range and the ALHAMBRA magnitudes of CVs from SDSS.

## Description of the folders

-) The folders named "QSOs-??-spectros" contain the file.json with the ALHAMBRA magnitudes (there is a file.json for each source). These folders also contain the SED (magnitude vs filter) of each source.
Folders are classified according to the redshift range ie;

 *QSOs-010-spectros -> 0.01<z<1.0
 *QSOs-101-spectros -> 1.01<z<2.0
 *QSOs-201-spectros -> 2.01<z<3.0
 *QSOs-301-spectros -> 3.01<z<4.0
 *QSOs-401-spectros -> 4.01<z<5.0

-) The folder "CVs-spectros" contain the ALHAMBRA magnithed (file.json) and plot of magnitude vs filter of each CV.
